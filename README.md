# KiCad Library and Templates

This repository contains a KiCad library of my commonly used components as well as template projects for creating new boards with proper settings.

The libraries are designed to be imported/copied into projects so that the projects are "self-complete". That means, you would not link this library directly. This library is just a holding spot for copying into the projects.

The templates are designed to be used with "new project from template" when creating a new board.
